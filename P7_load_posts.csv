"1","No life will survive the death of the sun — but new life could be born after, new research suggests","2019-07-05 14:01:31","As Earth sails through the solar system, the wind is never at our backs; at every turn, torrents of hot, charged particles called solar wind come streaming out of the sun, crashing into our planet at about 1 million mph (1.6 million km/h)."
"2","What would happen to our planet if the sun suddenly disappeared?","2020-06-29 23:39:31","If the sun were to suddenly vanish, the effects would be felt immediately.

"1","Unravelling the knotty problem of the sun's activity","2021-06-25 15:20:11","A new approach to analyzing the development of magnetic tangles on the Sun has led to a breakthrough in a longstanding debate about how solar energy is injected into the solar atmosphere before being released into space, causing space weather events. The first direct evidence that field lines become knotted before they emerge at the visible surface of the Sun has implications for our ability to predict the behavior of active regions and the nature of the solar interior. Dr. Christopher Prior of the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, will present the work today at the virtual National Astronomy Meeting (NAM 2021)."
